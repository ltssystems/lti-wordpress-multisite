# lti-wordpress-multisite
WIP code for connecting an lms through LTI to a wordpress multisite

The LTi is a WordPress plogin which allows the multisite versions of WordPress to act as an IMS LTI tool provider so that its blogs 
can be linked directly from a course in a VLE. A student, after signed into a VLE, e.g. Moodle, is able to directly launch into his/her WordPress 
sub-site. Single sign-on only! If the sub-site for the student has not been built in the WordPress installation, a new sub-site will be built 
and for the student. In the sub-site, the student is the owner, and so can publish new posts and do other things as an administrator of a 
WordPress. The sub-site can be accessed by public as well.
